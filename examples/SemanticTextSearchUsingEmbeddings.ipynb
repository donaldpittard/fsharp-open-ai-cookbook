      "Handy: Love the idea of ready in a minute pasta and for that alone this product gets praise.  The pasta is whole grain so that's a big plus and it actually comes out al dente.  The vegetable marinara sauce is tasty, but has a high salt content - 710mg for a 9 oz. serving.<br /><br />It looks like much thought and testing went into creating the packaging, but I found it challenging.  You need to pull back the film to expose the sauce tray -- and not spill it.  I had to pull hard on the film, which made the sauce cup wiggle.  Easy to work around, but tricky nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all a step up from usual microwave in a minute fare.\n",
